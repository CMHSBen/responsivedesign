		<h1>Girraffes are slowly going extinct</h1><p>Are giraffes endangered? The answer is ambiguous. Some giraffes are critically endangered, while others are threatened species. Thankfully, conservation efforts are bringing about a change for many wild giraffes.</p>

		<div><p>According to the <a href="https://www.iucn.org/">IUCN</a>, there were 11,048 mature adult girraffe  in the wild in 2018. This estimate follows a 56% decline over three generations or 30 years. The IUCN estimates that these populations are still in decline, although their habitat is not fragmented.</p>

		<p>All the typical reasons are at play: loss of habitat, civil unrest and poaching. But since giraffes were never afforded protection from trade until 2019 (thanks to the hard work of IFAW and aforementioned conservationists), pointing precisely to illegal trade of their parts is difficult. </p>
